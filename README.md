# pi-anobar

This workspace is a raspberry pi hosted pandora radio project.

The system comes up, gets on WiFi and start playing pandora.  The raspberry pi advertises a web page which is the user
interface for Pandora.  The user interface allows thumbs up, skip, changing stations, album art and things like that.

This was written years ago and is pretty primitive and uses none of the currently available user interface tools.

The second goal here is to get used to adding a github repository.
